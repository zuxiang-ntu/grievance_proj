# general workflow
# 1a. open "Preparing_session" file and run codes to import database excel into R session, create "table_analysis" dataframe that will be used for all subsequent data visualisation and analysis, and create vector strings that will be used to convert parts of data from wide format to long format.
# 1b. If unable to create "table_analysis" dataframe, the same "tablae_analysis" is also saved as an excel file that can be imported into the R session. Then load packages and vector strings listed in "Prearing_session" that will bw used to create figures. 
# 2. open files named according to subsections in manuscript as needed to run codes for figures and tables that will be presented in the manuscript. There are collapsable lines of code for additional information that won't necessarily be presented in the manuscript. Things like frequency tables to know the count of different variables, statistical summaries of duration and complexity score etc. 
# 3. copy figure images from the "Plots" pane and paste into manuscript. For tables, I convert the output to csv format, then copy output from "Console" and paste into excel so that I can further format the table from there.
